Hi, I'm MrShareware, mostly because all of the other names I liked were taken.
That will teach me for coming late to the party.
Now that I'm here I plan on making a few applications and code snippets
available in the public domain.

Current Languages: vb.net, html, javascript, css, python (beginner)
Current Databases: sql server, mysql, access

Past Languages: Too many. I'm an old MrShareware.
