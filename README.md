Hi, I'm MrShareware, mostly because all of the other names I liked were taken.
That will teach me for being late to the party.
Now that I'm here I plan on making a few applications and code snippets
available in the public domain so look for some vb.net, sql, python,
and whatever else I think may be interesting.

Current Languages: vb.net, html, javascript, css, python
Current Databases: sql server, mysql, access
